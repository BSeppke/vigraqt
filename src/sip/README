Unfortunately, it is non-trivial to compile this python module.
If you find a way to integrate this in the autoconf/automake system, I
would be very grateful for any hints.  The same goes for additional
documentation / information to put here.  So far, you're more or less
on your own; as you can see in the Makefile.am in this directory, I
created the Makefile.am in the vigraqt subdir with sip, which means
you'll have to re-run automake & autoconf. :-(
