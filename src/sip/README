Unfortunately, it is non-trivial to compile this python module.
If you find a way to integrate this in the autoconf/automake system, I
would be very grateful for any hints.  The same goes for additional
documentation / information to put here.

ATM, you have to do a "make -f Makefile.sip" in src/sip, then
configure with --enable-python and "make && make install".

Unfortunately, automake parses the "include vigraqt_buildinfo" which
means that I cannot simply call sip in the builddir automatically. :-(
