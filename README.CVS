I stopped putting auto-generated files into CVS, since there were too
many problems with these.  Now, you need autoconf and automake to
create the configure script; I added an autogen.sh which should
prepare everything as needed.

So, just run:

./autogen.sh
./configure or ./configure --prefix=$HOME/whatever
make
make install
