`colorize` is a small example showing the use of both the QImageViewer
and the ColorMap[Editor] classes.

Note that it is not compiled by default, but contains a .pro file that
expects VigraQt to be already installed; this way, the .pro file
serves as a template for the project file of a real, independent
application.
